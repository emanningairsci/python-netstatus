This project is documented extensively with Python docstrings. PyDoc is
used to convert these docstrings into [text format](docs/) for use outside of a
Python interpreter.

Implementation details may change at any time, so don't depend on
anything that isn't documented. I may also switch to using kwargs
instead of ordered arguments for function calls and/or object
instantiations, if it seems like that would be useful. For now, I'm
working on the assumption that "you aren't gonna need it."
