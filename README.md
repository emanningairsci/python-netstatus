This project is documented extensively with Python docstrings. PyDoc is
used to convert these docstrings into text format for use outside of a
Python interpreter.

See [objects.pydoc](docs/objects.pydoc) for information about
the objects package.

See [networkobject.pydoc](docs/networkobject.pydoc) for
information about the NetworkObject base class.

See [httpserver.pydoc](docs/httpserver.pydoc) for information
about the HTTPServer class, which inherits from NetworkObject.
